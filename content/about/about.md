## What
Thi website hosts guides and tutorials that are simple, fast, and clutter-free!

## Why
You probably are sick of clicking on the first article that pops up after searching "How to ... ?", just for it to be a website filled with ads, trackers, and innefficient materials. Many of those are AI-generated, making them unreadable and unrelatable. To fix that, I made this website that will avoid having all that stuff. This is just a simple website.

## How
This website is built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I am using [Luke Smith's "lugo" theme](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lugo), and follow a similar structure to his [recipe website](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/based.cooking).
**NOTE**: This website does use Javascript in some places, however, it is kept to a minimal. Most other things, as you can see, is pure HTML and CSS!

## Who
I will update this page with more information about who I am and what I do.
