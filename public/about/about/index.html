<p>This website is built using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a>. I am using <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lugo">Luke Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;lugo&rdquo; theme</a>, and follow a similar structure to his <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/based.cooking">recipe website</a>.
<strong>NOTE</strong>: This website does use Javascript in some places, however, it is kept to a minimal. Most other things, as you can see, is pure HTML and CSS!</p>
